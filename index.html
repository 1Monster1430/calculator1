        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="me">Hello, I’m Alwen T. Casagan, a dedicated web developer with a passion for crafting innovative, responsive, and visually engaging websites. At the age of 17, I’ve already built a solid foundation in modern web development technologies, ranging from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to more advanced tools like Python and frameworks like Pygame. My journey into web development started with a curiosity about how websites work behind the scenes, and this fascination quickly grew into a full-fledged passion for designing and coding.
            Over the years, I’ve honed my skills by working on a variety of projects, from building interactive web applications to creating sleek, professional portfolios. I thrive on turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient code. My focus is always on creating user-friendly experiences—websites that not only look great but also function flawlessly across devices.
            In addition to web development, I’m constantly expanding my knowledge by exploring new technologies and trends in the tech industry.</p>
